INTRODUCTION.

Μ

The little book we now beg to present to the
public in its original form, is not only one of the
rarest, but one of the most remarkable productions
of the very fertile Netherland press in the begin-
ning of the 17th century. However small and unas-
suming in appearance, it was not only the first pu·
blication issued concerning Hudsons most famous

,. ‚ voyage, but contains also ev'ery thing we know of

the plans of that great mariner. Mr. Murphy’s elever
essay indeed already directed the attention of the
public to this side of the book. In it, and in
Dr. Ashers learned disquisition concerning Hudson ,
the reader will find a detailed ,account respecting the
great importance of what is here related from very
good sources about Hudsons voyage, and of the mass
which accompanies this description. Only >this would
be sufficient to justify a reprint of this little book, os
