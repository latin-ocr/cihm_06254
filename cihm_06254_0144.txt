In order then, to promote in some measure, the know·
ledge of the locality of these lands (which our merchants
have acquired by these previous voyages), we now place in
your hands an account of the new dominion of the Russians
in the lands of Tartary, whence may be seen the agreement
with the very interesting drawings of Jan Huyghen, and the
further situation of the countries lying on yonder side the
river Oby.

Besides this description of Siberia and the most northerly
part of Tartary, we likewise hand you a map, translated
from the Russian, of all the adjoining countries, deline-
ating the entire sea to the east of Waygats, and a way to
proceed to the south of Cathay. But if the passage were
situated too far to the north (as it appears from the imp), it
might, to iudge from appearances, have been possible to get
by water to the Oby‚ or any other of the large rivers , for
those coasts are indeed always navigated by the Russians
with their canoes or small vessels, and then they proceed
inland with boats by water or by land, and it seems one
might then discover remarkable things. But as the Waygats
is only open or unthawed for a short time in summer, as ap·

pears from the two expeditioris made thither by J. Huygen ’

and W. Barentsz, this exploration could not easily be made,
for it appears that nature has plaz-0³. the cold and the ice
there as our enemies to moderate our desires3-—yet notwith—
standing all the examples of such excellent men as W. Barentsz,
J. Heemskerk δι J. Huyghen and the unlucky voyage which
Kerckhoven performed for Isaac Le Maire, still some inexpe-
rienced reckless men have boldly dated to request the Noble
Lords of the Admiralty, and the Mighty Lords the States,
again to appoint them to sail to the north-east above Nova
Zembla, confidently affirming it to be, at the height of 7²
