Into the river Tobol a river falls which seems to descend
straight from the North and from the mountains‚ near the
sea-side, and is called by the savages Taffa. Near this same
river the Muscovites have recently built a city called Pohem
¹and stocked it with all kinds of people from the Siberian
cities because there is such fine tillage-land all round about the
country and fine forests full of game‚ of leopards‚ lynxes‚
foxes, civem, sabels and matters.

This city is situated at the distance of two weeks’journey
from Tobolsca, to the north of the afore-mentioned river
YrtyS‚ which throws itself also into the Oby, at the distance
of a fortnights’j0urney from Tobolsca and at the mouth of
‘this river there was formerly also built a city named Olscoy-
gorot. This city was however cleared away by order of the
Governor in Siberia‚ without assigning any reason, Ilthink
it was on account of the coId, orbecause, according to their
opinion, it was too near the sea-side, fearing that some secret
attack or alteration rright be made. A large extent of water
supplied by the great river Oby embraces as with an arm an
extensive tract of land, again falls into the Oby, and then
Forms ·a large island. On that island they built another city
instead of the ruined one, calling it Zergolt‚ and it was situ-
ated about 50 miles higher up than the former had stood.

And when people -sail from there up the river, they use
very little tackle for their boats‚ either because there is little
wind, or on account of the elevation of the country, for
although the Oby is very large and wide, they pull the
boats, as is done along nearly all rivers in Muscovy. Tra-
velling from Zergolt· about 200 miles upward they arrive at
. a castle called Norinscoy‚ built about 13 years ago, when
the Great Governor sent men from Siberia in quest of lands
fit for people to live in, aud to build cities. Then they built
