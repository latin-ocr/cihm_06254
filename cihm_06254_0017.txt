the sailing round that island, — like his friend
Gerritsz., at that time despaired of the practicability

os-his old plan. At all events it is certain, that both -

Plancius and Gerritsz. expected much from the new
mad, which Hudson , after the frustration of his first
plan, had pursued‚ --· in the search of which Davis
had already , in 1580 , reaped many a laurel and on

’ which Hudson himself had placed many an impor-

tant step onward: the passage in' the north-west. This
opinion was to find more and more adherents among

’ the public , and with this object Gerritsz. published

in 1612, the little work now reprinted and placed
behind this. >Two particulars were , of course, to be
discussed in it: the little chance of success the way
by the north-east offered ‚ and the great advantages
which the discovery of the north-west passage pro-
mised to the discoverers. Concerning the practicability
of this plan, it was necessary to state at the same
time, what the most recent voyages had brought to
light in this respect.

Gerritsz. himself undertook to recommend the north·
western passage; for the obtaining of information
concerning the north-eastern road he applied to his
countryman Isaac¹ Massa , who , by the rich ‘store of
knowledge he had amassed in Russia itself, had come
to the same conclusion Hessel Gerritsz. had.

The name of Isaac Massa is, as many others we
have just mentioned , only but recently placed in the
honourable light it deser-ves, ln 1864 , a short bio·
