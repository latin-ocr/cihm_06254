back home along this road. Therefore the King Philip orde-
red a strong f ort to be built on the northern coast of Mar

. Vermejo, to the west of New Grenada, to prevent our na-

 

tion or any of his enemies from depriving him, through this
avenue, of the riches he possesses in peace near Mar del Zur;

This road then, if it continues as it appears, will afford
our people access, not only to the Chinese‚ the Molueks, or
Peru; but likewise enable them to go and see what nations
live on the south side of the South Sea, what harbours and
merchandises are to be found there; as they will find every
where plentiful refreshments, whether they go to the islandS,
whither the Bishop of Quito went (of which we have got
information from one of our countrymen who has been there

  
       
   
     
     
     
   
       

with said Bishop, and related a good deal about it to the ⁹

Advocate Barneveld and the Honor-able Lords Directors of
the East-India-Company), or whether they land on the con-
tinent, whereof 1 now hand you a discourse and narrative,
hoping that this may be agreeable to all those who traffic in
the remote parts of the earth, and also to all who liketo know
more and more of the globe and its inhabitants; which know-
ledge I hope may increase in you to perfection and bring you
riches and unperishable honour. ι
