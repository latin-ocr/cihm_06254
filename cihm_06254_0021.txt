when he immediately set to work, augmented what
Massa had collected with a few additional notes and had
this printed. He then added a map of the discoveries
of Hudson in the north-west, which he had composed
after an English original copy. He augmented the
same with a. short relation of the expeditioris of the
traveller, which he borrowed from the accounts of
Plancius. F inally, a short account of the able voyager ,

-Pedro Fernandez De Quiros, was added, in which

the latter largely commented on the wonders of a
country discovered by him , which was generally be-
lieved to be the long sought-for, but as yet unknown
southern continent, and which seemed to be easily ·

·· accessible along the road discovered by Hudson,

even since the way- through the strait of Magellan
was closed to competitors of the East-India Company.
Hessel Gerritsz. himself wrote a short introduction,
in which he gave a short survey of the origin of the
relations of the Netherlanders with Russia‚ and the
far off north—easterly countries, and of the expeditions
already made sor the discovery of the northern passage.

So the little book , which thus made its appearance
at the commencement of 1612 , consists of several
parts which, at first sight, seem to bear but little
relation to each other, but, on a closer inspection,
severally appear to have only one object in view: that
of recommending the finding out osa northern passage ,

· and more particularly one in the direction approved

of by Hessel Gerritsz. We find in this collection:
1. Introduction.
