of the fruits I so longed for and solicited, since the honour
and glory of God and your Majesty's service are so deeply
concerned in the matter, and infinite good will be the result,
which will last as long as the world standS, from hence
forth unto all eternity.

1. Concerning the extent of these recently discovered lands‚

tinue as they promise to do, there will be found lands op·
posite the foot of the best of Africa, the whole of Europe
and the greater part of Asia MaJ'or.
