ties of God, now reserved for your happy times, 1 desire
a servant's recompense, Sire, my appointment and dismissal‚
for the galleys are waiting3 also I have a good deal to travel‚
and to get ready and arrange, while many spiritual and tem-
poral intel-ests are hourly involved, and can never more be
recovered.

Christopher Colon, was rendered obstinate by his suspi-
cion only —- what makes me so troublesome‚ is what 1 have
seen and touched and now propose. Wherefore may it please
your MaJesty to order that among the many remedies‚ only
one may be awarded, that I may obtain what I desire, while
I promise to be found very reasonable in all things and give
entire satisfaction. ·

Sire‚ this is a work of vast importance‚ since the Devil
himself wages such bloody warfare against it, and it beseems
not that vhe should be found so powerful, while your Ma-
jesty is its Low* Protector.
