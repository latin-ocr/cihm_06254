has understood many things wrong, and that the Russians
have told his interpreter, F rancois de la Dale, that no icc
whatever is found ten or twenty miles through the strait of
Weygats, so we leave this matter, as being as yet uncertain,
in suspense. On the first place noted, of which Massa says
that he will prove that one may not go through Weygats,
it must be observed that he settles the matter somewhat
roundly3 for it had been done by the Enkhuysers, and could

· therefore be done again, but it is evident that it could not

be done every year.

And in the second place noted, he says that it can not be
done in a hundred years, however of the three times, that it
has been tried by our Dutchmen, it has succeeded once. The
second time they had already come to the states-island, from
whence, through fear of being locked in by the ice, they·
returned.

And the doubts concerning the Strait of Anian , as this is
generally called, he also describes somewhat loosely, for he
grounds his doubt hereupon, that he does not know how
the pecple could have got into America, if there were a wide
space between the continent of Asia and America3 although
the Chinese and Japanese to the West, as also our nation to
the East of it, have both had for long ages always vessels,
with which they might easily have been transported.

This I have still to note, that I have spoken of the acci-
dent of the Amersfoort clerk on Nova Francia much too
decidedly in the preface, for a matter is sometimes very dif-
ferent from what it at first appears, and as the causes why
any thing happens are newly always unknown to us, we
cannot at all positively assert such things.
