 

PREFACE

The collection of tracts on Arctic discoveries by Hudson and the
other Explorers, edited by Hessel Gerritsz. in 1612, has been often
reprinted both in Dutch and in Latin. These texts, however, which
present important variations, have not hitherto been printed together,
nor in any edition have all the maps been given.

As this collection has been, and always will be, the principal
source of our knowledge about these important researches‚ 1 have
considered it advisable in the interest of science, to reproduce the
very rare Dutch original, the Latin translation, and all the ωερε,
thus utilising my good fortune as possessor of both editions.

A quite new and extremely careful translation into English has
been added, the old one in the rare collection of Purchas‚ 1625,
being incomplete, inem-tect, and difficult to obtain.

As the various tracts in the book of Hessel Gerritsz have at first
sight but slight internal connection, and as the idea of their combi-
nation and publication may be to many mind obscure, 1 have entrea-
ted Mr. S. Muller to explain the origin and design of the collec-
tion. Being the author of the „History of the Dutch Northern

Company'' he indeed, is the most competent authority upon the

subject.
