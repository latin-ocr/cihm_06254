graphical sketch of his life appeared, which clearly ’ ’ 1

points out the many claims he has to the gratitude
of posterity. Isaac Massa, born at Haarlem in 1587 ,
was sent, about 1600, to Russia to acquire a know·

'ledge of business there. During a residence of eight years ¹ ,

he obtained an extensive knowledge of that empire, .
at that time nearly quite unknown. That he, subse-
quently, availed himself of that knowledge, for the .
forming of commercial relations between his native
country 'and the land in which he sojourned, - - that

he afterwards resided for a series of years, as an  
agent of the States-General at Moscou, —- that his ’
economical merits were by no means of an inferior t

kind, are particulars which it would be out of place
here to dwell upon. Our attention is now rather more
especially directed to Massa's great merit in having
supplied us with works, which are nearly the only
source from which we derive the knowledge of Rus, ’
sia’s geographical and social position, during the first ’
years of the 17th century. Massa himself already saw
the great importance, which the reports collected by „

him coneerning Russia‘s northern coast and Siberia, —- ’

but only just conquered by the Czars —, might have
sor the discovery of the north passage to East-India,
so ardently hoped for.

He had already, previous to the year 1612 , express-
ed his desire to Prince Maurice, that he might be -
of some service to his country, as Heemskerk and

others had already· been ;'’ he had even carried on 'J
negotiations ·’
