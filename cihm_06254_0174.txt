of their great intercourse and close contact‚ for which reason
and on account of the goodness of the land and because they
have no guns or other murderous fite-works to massacre each
other, and as they do not work in silver-mine8‚ and for
many other reasons, it is probable that the population is
very numerous. But it cannot be perceived that they are
acquainted with any particular art or science, and they have
no walls nor strongholds, nor king, nor law, being only a
lot of bad heathens, divided into parties and not agreeing

gouges, chisels, saw5, pick-axes and large and small orna-

countries, all of which is a certain sign of the vicinity of a
people of superior civilisation, and no less mark of this is
