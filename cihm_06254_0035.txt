of Purchas. The collection was furthermore reprint-
ed no less than five times in Dutch workS, (1) and
the spread of the work went even farther than this.
One can scarcely take up any volume, written in the
seventeenth century about the northern passage,
without finding the visible traces that the pamphlet,
written by Hessel Gerritsz. was the head-fountain
and often supplied the only spring of information.
lt not unsrequently happened that the text was, either
partially or entirely, simply re-printed, without the
writer's name being mentioned. The contents of the
interesting work may thus -be at last considered as
the common property os the learned. The book itself
however, long remained little known, and only very
recently it attracted again the general attention.

- Meanwhile copies of it had become very rare, and it

cannot but be very welcome to the lovers of geography
and history, to know that it is now at last reprinted
in its original form, devoid of all additions, altera-

tions or curtailments‚ which such a work as this is

so likely to underg0‚ at the appearance of every new
edition in large collections; and especially in trans-
lationS, such as the seventeenth century could fur-

’ nish forth.
