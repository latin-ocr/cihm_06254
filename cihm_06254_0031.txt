with general applause. The reports concerning Hud-
son's voyage to the north-west and the .new fairy-
country, discovered by De Quiros, attracted the atten-
tion to such a degree, that in 1612 two reprints of
the »Description of the Samoyeds'' were necessary.

As a skilful editor Hessel Gerritsz. knew directly
how to adjust his tackle to the wind. Without ornit-
ting any of Massa's most important pieces, he simply
altered the title of his work, and the order os suc-
cession of the several pieces inserted in it, and thus
again directed the attention to those several parts os
his collection, which had suited the taste of the
public most. Already in a second issue of the Dutch
book, he* amplified his notes of Hudson’s voyage and
placed thern , as a separate relation, at the commen·
cernent ol the work, which, this time, retained the
same title. In the following edition, which appeared

title was altogether changed. Hudson‘s voyage now
made a prominent figure. The work was called:
