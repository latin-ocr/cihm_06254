Sire ,Ι

1, captain Pedro Fernandez de Qun, declare that this is the
eighth request‚ Ι have presented to your Majesty‚ concerning
the population as it should take place in the country, which
your Majesty has ordered to be explored in the regions of
the unknown Australia. Without any resolution having been
taken with me, nor any answer or hope given assuring me
of my appointment‚ notwithstanding a sojourn of 14 months
at this court and having been engaged for 14 years in trans-
acting this business without saIary, or any thing done. to my
profit, acting only from motives of goodness; and Ihave
had to struggle with innumerable continual opposition and
travelled 20000 miles by sea and land, having spent all my
property, suffered personal destitution‚ and endured so many
and dreadful things, that they seem to me almost incredi-
ble, and all that not to give up a work of so much mercy
and devotion. — For which reason and for the love of God
Ι humbly beseech your Majesty that he may be pleased not ⁸
to allow me, after such constant labour and anxiety‚ after so

much perseverance and well founded efforts, to be deprived .
