that new route: and among the advantages result-
ing from it, Gerritsz. points out, especially, the oppor-
tunity of visiting the almost unknown southern con·
tinent.

After this introduction, which bears right on to the
object Gerritsz. had in view, follow the two pieces
of Massa. It has already been stated above, that the
first work treats of the oldest commercial relations ot
Russia with Siberia, and of the conquest which then
soon followed of that country. Other particulars of
this matter may be found in the interesting work of
Dr. Hamel entitled »Tradescant der Aeltere in Russ-

land‚ 1618.'' Massa's second composition, more exten· Ἰ

sive than the first , mentions the commercial roads
from Russia to -Siberia and describes the manners
and customs of the tribes living there. According to
the title it is »translated from the Russian language

anno 1609.” From the contents it appears that this ,

»translation'' is very free. Massa speaks in it of things
which have happened to himself, and among others

of Le Maire's request to be a sharer himself in the . .

north-polar expedition of 1609. It is therefore most

probable that, in the composition of the work, he
had before him the above mentioned notes of the Ἴ
brother of his Russian landlord, who had himself

been present at the 'subjugating expedition. Of a =

printed* original Russian copy there can be no ques-
tion here, considering the well-known secrecy of the

Russian government of those days , alluded to by ’
Massa ’
