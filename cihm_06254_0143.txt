the further knowledge spread by and by, induced Olivier
Brunel, born iu Brussels, to sail thither in asmall vessel from
Enchuysen3 he roamed about hither and thither iu the vici·
uity and amassed in the Petzora much wealth onsisting of
furs, Russian glass and crystal de Montagne, which with the
boat were lost in >the river Petzora. -Thereupon‚ the former
expeditioris of the English, and of Olivier Brunel who had
likewise been in Costinsarck on Nova Sembla, having raised
in our Dutchrnen a desire of gain, and enticed them by the
riches of China and Cathay, to which they hoped to find
access along these coasts, the Right Honorable States of the
United Provinces dispatched thither two vessels, that were to
go with Jait Huyghen of Linschoten to Waygats, and two
others w1th Willem Barentsz., that were directed through the
inducement of Rev. Petrus Plancius to proceed to the North
and sail round above Nova Sembla. But Willem Barentsz. “
being locked up between the land ancl the ice, at the long-
itude of 77 degrees near the islands of Orange, returned
on the first day of August, and Jan Huyghen sailed quite
through the strait of Waygats, ancl fifty miles further3 but
on account of the north-east wind, and the year being
far spent, came back also. Both sailed out again the next
year in 1595, intending to place their marks further, or to
find the passage quite through3 but the cold and ice debar-
ring their progress, they could not effectuate their purpose,
sor they could not pass the Waygats. And Willem Ba-
rentsz., who got a little further on his third expedition in the
year 1596 than he could get on his first undertaking, left
his vessel there on the ice-berghs for a mark and perpetual
memorial of the extreme sailing in the North, whose adven-
turous history, sad end and the crews wonderful return ho·
meward‚ one may read in their» printed Journals.
