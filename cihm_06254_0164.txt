mentioned they observed several huts in the fields and hordes
of people gathered together, but as they had Samoyeds and
Tartars as guides‚ who might have travelled over these ways,
they were not afraid.

The people, they met, came unto them with humble behav-
iour and signified by the Samoyeds and Tartars, that they
called themselves Tingoesy, that they dwelled along the great
river, which they called Jeniscea, and said it sprung from
the South·East‚ without knowing its source; but that it was
a larger river than the Oby. The people were deformed with
swellings under their throats and in their speech they thratled
like turkey-cocks. Their language seemed not much to differ
from that of the Samoyeds‚ which understood also many of
their words.

The Jeniscea, being a river much larger than the Oby,
has high mountaifis on the East, among which are some
vulcanoeS, which cast out brimstone. But on this side to the
West, the country is plain and fertile, stored with divers
plants, trees, fine flowers and many strange fruits, besides
very rare fowl. This flat country is overflowed in spring
by the Jeniscea about 70 leagues, in like manner, as they
report unto us, as the Nile does in Egypt. Wherewith well
acquainted‚ the Tingoesy do keep beyond the river in the
mountains, untill its decrease, andvthey then return with all
their cattle into these fertile plains. The Tingoesy, being
a very gentle people, by the persuasion of the Samoyeds,
without delay submitted themselves to the same Governors,
which they reverenced nearly as Gods. What God these
people worship, is uncertain, neither as yet can be known,
the Moscovites being negligent searchers into such things.

And I am by no means surprised that Waygats is filled up
so every year with ice in the North, as the large rivers Oby
