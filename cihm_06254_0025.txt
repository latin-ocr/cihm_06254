Massa himself , in every thing relating to Russian,
and especially to Siberian geography.

After Massa's writings follows in the work of
Hessel Geiritsz. a petition of Pedro Fernandez De
Quiros, presented to Philip 111. 1t is necessary to
say a *few words about this little work. Who were
the first discoverers of Australia, when and how that
discovery took place, is likely to remain a secret.
The uncertainty prevailing on this point is still in-
creased by the fact, that the first reporters generally
do not distinguish at all, between Australia and the
little known southern polar continent. lt is certain

   
    
   
   
   
   
    

Ἴ however, that at a very early period we notice on
· the map many indications, proving that Australia,

  
  

long before we were aware of this, was known in
Spain and Portugal and even in France and England.
While, however, silence prevails in books concerning
this matter, it remains still undecided, whether the
mention of Australia in these maps must be attri-
buted to an actual discovery, or to a certain convict-
ion of the real existence of an extensive country at
the southern pole, similar to the supposition prevai·

     
     
 
    

, ling in the mind of Columbus concerning the exist-
. enee of America. That conviction was so firm, that

  
  

it may be considered as the cause, which induced
the Spaniards and Portuguese to undertake so many
voyages to those parts —- enterprises which soon led
to the discovery of small portions of that quarter of
the globe, which is now known by the name of

3 Australia.
