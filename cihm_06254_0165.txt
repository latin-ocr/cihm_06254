and Yeniscea throw forth such vast quantities of lce, and
also innumerable other rivers, whose names are unknown,
that cast up such immense blocks of thick ice that it can
scarcely be believed. ’

For in spring the ice carries off entire forests, near the
sea-side, by its huge strength and size3 this is the cause why
vast quantities of floating-wood are strewn all along the coast
of Waygats. Also in the strait of Nova Zembla, the cold is
intensest, and it is therefore not surprising that the ice is
heaped up in its narrow passage, and freezes on and 0113
thus closely pressed together, it gets the thickness of 60 or
at least 50 fathorns.

This was ascertained this year by men, who were again
sent out in a small vessel by Isaac le Maste, and who would
gladly have had me too, but 1 declined the offer, for Ι will
show that this passage is inaccessible and will always be so,
unless some other course be taken. ’ K

The Muscovites also made a larger voyage along this river,
but kept on in a straight easterly direction, hardly venturing
to go South‚ and they had some of these Tingoesy with
them, of whom they understood, that in the South there
lived many nations that were quite strange to them, and
who had also kings who often went to war with each other.

Not having then met with any one, they returned, after
some days'travelling, but ordered the Tingoesy to search
farther on, who promised to do so, and contracted friend-

presents. Next year the Tingoesy, on their side, sent people
Eastwards‚ still further than they· had been before, and went
thither in great numbers. At last they found a large river,
not quite'so wide as the Jeniseea, but with as rapid astream,
