Into the great river Oby there falls also another river,
which they call Taas, and which. seems to come frorn the
vicinity of the Jeniscea out of a large wood‚ whence also
another river flows, not far from the one already named, and
falls into the Jeniscea. So they can travel by water from
the Oby through the meadow-land of the Samoyeds3 pro·
ceeding only two miles by land, the'y corne to a river called
Torga1f, and arrive with the falling water in the Ieniscea3
this is very convenient for travelling and was recently dis-
covered by the Samoyeds and Tingoesy.

But it is! a pity that the Dutch have not succeeded in get· -

ting through Waygats‚ and they do not know how to set
about it3 with vessels they will not succeed, had they tried
it a hundred times over. And if they would pry into all

¹ these lands, they should be obliged to remain there two or

three years near VVaygats or Pechora‚ where they would
find good harbours and provisions. Thence they should
send people in boats‚ as the Russians do, and also contract
friendship with the Russians‚ who would then willingly show
the way, and so all would be discovered.

Many fine places would be found out, islands and solid
land; but it is to be doubted whether America near China
is not connected with these three parts of *the world by a
strait‚ like that which unites Africa to Asia by the Red
Sea; and this is indeed very possible; for who can tell
whether it is open, except by what is found in some> wri-
tings of the heathenS‚ who assert that it is separated from
each other, for which they adduce manyproofs.

If however·it is open, the strait must be very narr0w‚ for
I had nearly said it would have been impossible for people
to get into America‚ because Adam was created in Asia,
and we read nowhere in Holy Scripture that sh'ips or
