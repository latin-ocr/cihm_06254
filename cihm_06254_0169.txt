sent out also men - by land, directing them to remain there
alongside the river, till they should discover these boats‚
enjoining them, if they did not find them , to return within
a year. Those whom he sent out to sea were ordered to
investigate all there was to be seen, and bade the Com·
mandet Luca to accompany thern, whom he instructed to
note down every thing, and so they departed. These men
accordingly arrived at the mouth of the afore-said river,
and they met each other there3 as those, who had gone by
land, had sent some on vrasts and boats {down the current
of the river, who met the boats on the sea-side and found
all as the Governor had told them before, namely according
to his opinion. As however their Commander Luca afore-
named had died. with some others of the chief men, they
found it advisable 3 separate from each other, and each to go
his own way, and so they arrived home again. On reaching
Siberia, they noted down every thing, making a good report
to the Governor, who sent it to the Emperor in Moscow‚
where this report was enclosed in the treasury in Moscow‚
till the wars should be ended3 then it would be examined;
but I suppose it was all lost, which is a great pity‚ for they
have found in‚it many rare things of islands and rivers,
birds and beasts, till far beyond the Jeniscea. .

As a good friend of mine i'n Muscovy had a brother sent
there, he gave me a blank map of it, as he had understood
from his brother-’s own lipS‚ who is nox more, but who had
himself been through Waygats and knew all places as far as
the Oby3 but wha‘t was beyond it he had only by hear-say}
so that said very small map is merely a sketch- relating to
the sea coast. 1 obtained it with much trouble, for if it
were discovered, it would eost that Muscovite his head,
and therefore we palis by his name in silence.
