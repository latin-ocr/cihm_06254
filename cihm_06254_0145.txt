days, This was also done by a certain Heliseus Roslin,a doc-
tor of Hanau, at the end of his little pamphlet (written and
dedicated to the Mighty Lords the States in 1610, on the 22
of December‚) in which (after many absurdities which he

With these opinions they sailed out in the spring of 1611 to
go far round above Nova Sembla‚ and thence, as their maps

suffered damage by the ice they ran into Moscovia for re-
pairs. Thence, without making any further attempts, they

But as the English after these aforesaid expeditions of W.

the north-east, the Gentlemeu Directors of the East India-
Company sent thither some years ago a certain Mr. Hudson ‚
who as he could find no way in the east, sailed towards
