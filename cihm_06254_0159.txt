On coming to afore-said Vergateria, the arrival of spring
must be awaited, as there is a river Toera which is very
shallow all the year round, deriving there its source, but
in spring the snow of the mountains makes it very deep and
they then travel further on by means ot boats and barges.

This city Vergateria is the first in the land of Siberia and
was built 21 years agn, with other cities round about, and
is well peopled; they also cultivate the land as they do in
Muscovy.

There is likewise a Governor, who sends every year in
spring a large quantity of provisions and grains, all along
these rivers throughout the Siberian land in all castles and
places where soldiers and military men are. This is the case
too beyond the Oby in all places and fortresses belonging to
the Muscovites, for there they do not as yet regularly culti-
vate the ground, the Samoyeds living on game, as has
already been stated.

, ⁴ Sailing down this river Toera, so called, they arrive after
five days at a city Japhanim , built two years ag0, and sup-
plied with inhabitants.

On reaching Japhanim, they travel on to said T oera and
after two days'j0urney‚ this river begins to take a very
crooked course, so that they ⁴are often obliged to seton
land to keep the right direction and take the shortest way.

This place is now inhabited by Tartars and Samoyeds,
who keep cattle as a means of subsistence, and have boats
besides.

After preceding from the river Toera, they come to a ¹

large river Tabab, this being about 200 miles from Vergateria.
Next, they reach' Tinnen , a well pedpled city, also built by
the same afore-said. Many travel also from Japhanim in
sledges during the winter, as far as Tinnen, in twelve days,
