and an extensive trade is now carried on in furs between
the Muscovites, the Tartars and Samoyeds; and this is a
very convenient place for those who want to be absent
only for half a year. Many however prefer going further
on, even far beyond the river Oby, as well East as South.

From Tinnen one reaches Tobolsca, the capital of the Siberian
cities; there is the seat of Siberia and the supreme Viceroy
of the Muscovites., and all cities must bring their annual
tribute from yonder side as well as this side the Oby‚ which
is collected and sent yearly, with an escort of Cossacks and
soldiers‚ to Moscow3 also strict J‘ustice is here administered.
And all Governors in Samoyeda and Siberia must obey this
Viceroy. There is also an extensive trade carried on in every
article brought from Muscovy thither. Also Tartars from the
south come at a great distance from Tartary, and many other
nations who gradually arrive there, in proportion as the fame
of the country spreads wider. This is very advantageous to
the Muscovites‚ who have peacefully annexed it, so that they
donot fear its inmates‚ who feel kindly disposed towards them.
There are also churches every where3 would to God the
cruel Spaniards had obtained possession of America in such
peaceful guise, instead of exercising such inhuman cruelty‚
then at least one might have not begrudged it them, for
much more may be gained through kindness asIhave noticed‚
and as may be daily seen in the example of the Muscovites‚
rather than with cruel tyranny or brute force.

This afore-said city Tobolsca is situated on the large river
Yrtys‚ which precipitately falls from the Sout h and flows as
fast as the Danube, falling into the river Oby. It appears
to derive its source from the same district as the Oby; on
the other side of ‘the city runs the afore-said river Tobol‚
whence the city derives its name. ’
